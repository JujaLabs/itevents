        :restservice:processResources UP-TO-DATE
        :restservice:classes UP-TO-DATE
        > Building 75% > :restservice:jettyRun > Running at http://localhost:8080/restservice

you can run the following in browser command line:

        http://localhost:8080/restservice
        
and test page of our application should be shown.

-- Run the next in browser command line:

        http://localhost:8080/restservice/events/{number}
        
where number is from 1 to 4.

-- To stop Jetty correctly open another Command line in directory 'restservice'.
